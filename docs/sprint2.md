You are a React Native expert.

In the FormScreen, do the following:

1. Read JSON config from /assets/form.json.
2. Based on field types, render corresponding inputs: TextInput, Checkbox, RadioButton.
3. For fields of type "signature", integrate `react-native-signature-canvas` and store as base64.
4. For fields of type "photo", use `expo-image-picker` to capture/select image.
5. Manage all form field states using useReducer or React context.

Use TypeScript and clean reusable component structure.
