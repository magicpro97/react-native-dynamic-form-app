You are a senior React Native developer.
Please complete the following tasks in a React Native project using Expo Router:

1. Initialize a new project using TypeScript.
2. Install and configure Expo Router v3.
3. Set up a clean production-ready folder structure: src/screens, src/features, src/components, src/lib, src/assets.
4. Create a login screen with a form that accepts username and password.
5. Validate that inputs are not empty. If valid, store mock token using MMKV or AsyncStorage.
6. Upon successful login, navigate to a Home screen (placeholder).
7. Create a sample JSON form config under /assets/form.json with several form fields.
8. In the HomeScreen, read the form.json and display the form title and number of fields found.
